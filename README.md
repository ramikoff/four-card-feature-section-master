## My process

### Built with

- SCSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- Responsive design
- CSS Flexbox 


Some CSS code I'm proud of

```css
body .container {
    margin: 0 auto 80px;
    display: -webkit-box;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: flex;
    -webkit-box-pack: center;
        -ms-flex-pack: center;
            justify-content: center;
    -ms-flex-wrap: wrap;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
    padding: 0; }

body .container .supervisor {
    border-top: 4px solid #45d3d3;
    -webkit-transform: translateY(50%);
    transform: translateY(50%); }    
```


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on: CSS Flex, Grid, mobile first approach, atomic CSS and BEM in future projects. These are concepts i am still not completely comfortable with or techniques i found useful that i want to refine and perfect.
